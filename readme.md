## Code

The main topic this week was: **[Teleop Code]**

Commands: **[Sequential Commands]**

Subsystems: **[]**

### How does the code work?
A operator uses an input device, such as a joystick to send commands to the robot. The input device communicates with a controller that processes the commands.The controller then sends the commands to the robot, typically using wireless communication and the robot receives the commands, interprets them, and executes the corresponding actions. This involves controlling motors or other actuators to move the robot or perform specific tasks. The primary goal of teleop code is to provide a seamless interface between the human operator and the robot, allowing for precise control and real-time adjustments.
